Covering the view

The expressions of the people are bright.

Today will be the happiest day in the history of the kingdom.

“The heroes who sealed the Demon King are returning!”

With the triumphant fanfare announcing the return of the victors, 

As colorful paper flowers rain down from the sky,

Two heroes fittingly described as handsome and beautiful passed through the triumphal arch.

“Warriors summoned from another world, because of your efforts, peace has been restored to the kingdom. On behalf of the goddess, I, Saint Ecclesia, express my deepest gratitude once again to you.”

The saint first stood before the male hero.

“Blade Master FranDal.”

“Yes, Saint.”

Chosen by the holy sword Grancia that sealed the Demon King, 

Blade Master FranDal, with his striking appearance, agile demeanor, and swordsmanship close to the divine, was the ideal model of a hero.

“Charging fearlessly into the heart of the enemy camp and cutting down the Demon King's army with a single strike, your spirit and loyalty have deeply resonated in the hearts of all the people. The names of you and the holy sword Grancia will forever be remembered as the names of the heroes who sealed the Demon King.”

“I am truly honored, Saint.”

The saint placed a wreath of honor on his head and blessed his name.

“Wow! Hero! You are so cool!”

“Not only a hero but also handsome!”

“Our eternal hero!”

The women in the square were so entranced by FranDal that they seemed to swoon and fell to the ground.

After waiting for the cheers of the women to die down, the saint stood beside the small-framed girl and lifted the wreath for her.

“The White Flame Mage, FlanMay.”

Chosen by the goddess's guardian dragon, Leviathus, the girl who wields white flames, FlanMay.

With her silvery hair tied in twin-tails, the delicate girl was a fairy of the battlefield, having burned the Demon King's army with her overwhelming magical power.

“…Yes★”

As she spoke, cheers erupted from the young men.

Her youthful voice sounded like pieces of stars rolling over transparent glass.

“FlanMay!! FlanMay!!”

“I love you, Hero!”

“Our fairy!!”

“FlanMay is totally an angel!”

“Despite her small stature, your ability to wield the guardian dragon's power freely and protect the people by incinerating the enemy forces was like a ray of sunshine shining in the darkness. Your name and that of the guardian dragon that chose you will also be remembered forever as the names of heroes who saved this country.”

“…”

FlanMay waved her hand shyly toward the cheering crowd but did not seem particularly cheerful.

“His Majesty the King and Princess Ibera are arriving!”

After the saint's blessing, to commend their achievements, the king and princess of the kingdom approached them.

“Blade Master FranDal. Because of you, this nation has been saved. As the king representing this land, and as a citizen of this country, and a servant of the goddess, I too express my deep gratitude to you.”

The king took FranDal's scarred hands and gazed into his honest eyes.

“No, Your Majesty. I could not have done this alone. It was possible thanks to my companions and the help of everyone in the kingdom.”

FranDal's answer was also ideal.

As if looking at a sculpture of a 'hero' painstakingly carved by a craftsman.

“Even after achieving such a feat of saving the world, to remain so humble…”

The king held FranDal's hands even tighter.

“With a person like you, I can entrust this country. Would you not marry my daughter Ibera and lead this kingdom on the right path?”

With the king's public declaration, a thunderous cheer erupted.

Is there a greater reward than this for the hero who saved the nation?

However, FranDal's expression didn’t change at the king's suggestion.

“I’m sorry, Your Majesty. But I have already promised my future to someone.”

“Is… is that really true?”

“When I fell into this kingdom without knowing anything, the only person I could rely on was… just one person, the only one with whom I could share my back. I have decided to love that person alone.”

FranDal carefully lowered the king's hand.

And then he held the hand of the White Flame Mage,

FlanMay.

“That…”

“My companion, FlanMay, is a precious comrade who fought alongside me to seal the Demon King, and she is the lover with whom I have traversed many battlefields. We traveled together, fought together, and gradually confirmed our feelings for each other. Without her efforts, I would not enjoy this glory.”

“Is it not possible even at the request of the king of this country?”

“I am honored by your words, but Your Majesty, how can one be called a hero if they heartlessly abandon a comrade who has shared a life-risking journey?”

The king looked into his blue eyes.

The gaze of a man who looked steadfastly at one point without any wavering.

No matter how much of a king he was, he could not deter the heart of such a hero.

“I see… to you, FlanMay has already become more precious than this kingdom.”

“Thank you for understanding, Your Majesty.”

Princess Ibera, who was watching FranDal from behind the king, also turned her head and quietly swallowed her tears.

It seemed she had somewhat expected his answer.

“I declare in front of all the citizens present as witnesses! I, Blade Master FranDal! No, Hero Ishiwoo, swear that I will share my future with my only companion, the White Flame Mage FlanMay, who sealed the Demon King together with me!”

FranDal revealed his original name from his former world,

Holding FlanMay’s hand, he loudly declared to all those in the square.

“FlanMay, it’s over. Now let’s live together in this world. Not for the kingdom, but for us.”

FlanMay’s silvery sky-blue eyes reflected Ishiwoo’s face, who was holding her shoulders.

“Please, will you stay with me for the future?”

When one starts to love someone,

The reason for wanting to share a future with someone boils down to two main feelings.

The first is believing that being with that person will make me happy.

“…”

Amidst the watching citizens of the kingdom, a shy girl,

The White Flame Mage FlanMay cautiously opened her mouth.

“Hey you jerk★”

-Slam!

FlanMay’s silver shoe charged toward Ishiwoo's shin.

Suddenly struck in the critical area, Ishiwoo tumbled down the stairs, 

Rolling under the red carpet.

“Ugh! FlanMay! What is this?”

“How many times do I have to tell you to understand? I said I was a boy★”

The soft-spoken girl with her white hair tied in twin-tails spewed out curses and insults.

“The White Flame Mage is a boy?”

“That beautiful twin-tailed girl?”

“FlanMay looks better in a pure white dress than the saint?”

“Unbelievable… Our hero can’t be like that! Say it’s not true!”

“Tell me instead that the Demon King has resurrected….”

The citizens in the square grew increasingly agitated at FlanMay’s remark.

Meanwhile, the Ishiwoo, who was knocked down by the mage girl’s kick, swallowed tears, clutching his swollen ankle with both hands.

“I told you when we first met, right? The last number of my resident registration is 1★”

“T-that's just a story from the previous world, but now you are the White Flame Mage Flan…”

FlanMay grabbed Ishiwoo by the collar and forcibly lifted him up.

“You bastard★ Do you think I don't know all the things you've done to try to get me? Throwing me into the slime den in the swamp, putting potions in my water bottle, trying to use the brainwashing magic from the Demon King's library★?”

“That’s just the rule of TS for female corruption….”

The strength in FlanMay's arms, which were holding Ishiwoo, intensified.

Without the title of Blade Master, Ishiwoo could not shake off the grip of that delicate girl.

“L-let me go….”

FlanMay threw Ishiwoo down into the crowd that had gathered in the square.

“Puhak!”

“Hero!”

“If you like it here so much, then live alone, you jerk★”

FlanMay tossed her shimmering silver hair and walked confidently toward the saint.

The graceful steps she usually displayed had vanished, and the hem of her dress fluttered vigorously as she walked with her legs widely apart.

“Hey, Saint★”

“Yes… yes!”

“Since we sealed the Demon King, you’re going to send me back to my original world, right★?”

“Y-yes, of course!”

“Then hurry up and open the gate★”

“Ah, understood!”

As the terrified saint began to chant the spell,

The space under the triumphal arch where Ishiwoo and FlanMay had entered twisted and revealed a rainbow-colored rift.

“Just so you know, if I return to my original world and still look like this, I won’t let you off★”

“D-don’t worry! Crossing through the gate will only allow the pure mana contained in the soul! The body will probably remain the same as it was before!”

“That’s good★”

“FlanMay…! Why do you want to leave? You could live as a hero here!”

Ishiwoo, sprawled out on the red carpet laid for the returning heroes, grabbed the hem of her dress, but FlanMay disregarded it and jabbed her staff against the back of his hand.

“Ugh!”

“Shut up★ I was about to confess to my childhood friend when I got pulled here★ Do you know how it feels to be hit by a truck right before confessing after ten years?★”

“…!”

“I’m dirty from being together, and let’s not see each other again★”

FlanMay kicked off Ishiwoo’s hand and boldly threw herself through the rainbow gate.

Left alone on the red carpet where victors tread, 

Everyone in the square was watching Ishiwoo.

“….”

The expressions of the people are bright.

Today will be the happiest day in the history of the kingdom.

It surely will be.
